I have three project I am working on

## Map Test Game

The first project is the [States Game Project](https://theowlseye.github.io/StateTest/)
* The design of the page needs work so my options are learn CSS or ignore this problem because 
  I don't care about desgin. 
* I am thinking of adding Europe

## Venn Diagram

Then there is the Venn Diagram [Project](https://theowlseye.github.io/VennDiagramClone2/)
* This project works! It creates an mathmatically precise venn diagram when given two sets and the resulting over lap 

## Hexagon Project

The Hexagon project is my first project using Cloud9 in AWS(Amazon Web Service) which is a real IDE.  
No more writing in notepad.  Here it is [Hexagons](https://theowlseye.github.io/BeatsTheHexOutofMe/)

* This project brings in the D3 library
* I am trying hard to use the git system of pushing changes onto github
* I really enjoy using the D3 library but I'm not using it to it's fullest potention.
* Ok I got really excited about D3 and then I discovered tranisitions and transforms and started doing more with animations than data and D3 stands for data driven documents so clearly my program was going into a different direction than what the D3 library is for.
* Now I am bringing in the SGAP library which is a library for animations and it is AMAZING! honestly all both of these libraries are amazing when did javascript become so amazing?
* I also added a Git client on my IPAD called "Working copy"  now I can code on my desktop and on my IPAD and pretend I am a two person team
