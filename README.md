I have two project I am working on

## Map Test Game

The first project is the [States Game Project](https://theowlseye.github.io/StateTest/)
* The design of the page needs work so my options are learn CSS or ignore this problem because 
  I don't care about desgin. 
* I am thinking of adding Europe

## Venn Diagram

Then there is the Venn Diagram [Project](https://theowlseye.github.io/VennDiagram/)
* Soooo much work to do on this project.  Right now it looks like just two overlapping circles.
