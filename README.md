I have two project I am working on


##The first project is the [States Game Project](https://theowlseye.github.io/StateTest/)
* The Design of the page needs work so my options are learn CSS or ignore this problem because 
  I don't care about desgin. 
* I am thinking of adding Europe

##Then there is the Venn Diagram [Project](https://theowlseye.github.io/VennDiagram/)
* Soooo much work to do on this project right now it's just to overlapping circles
